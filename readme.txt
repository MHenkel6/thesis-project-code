This git repository contains the code I wrote for my thesis project
"Distributed FDI for Thruster Faults in Formation Flying Satellites"

There are three distinct code projects that are contained in this repository
	1. The formation simulation, written in Matlab
	2. The network training, written in Python and run on Google Colab
	3. The network output evaluation, written in Python
